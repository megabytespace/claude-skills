name: "CI/CD Pipeline"
description: "GitHub Actions for auto-deploy on push to main, E2E tests on PR, branch preview deploys. Not relied on (Brian deploys live from CLI), but set up for future users and as safety net. Includes Playwright in CI, Lighthouse audit, and auto-merge for passing PRs."---

# CI/CD Pipeline
## Note on Usage
Brian deploys live from CLI (`npx wrangler deploy`). This pipeline exists for:
- Future contributors who use PRs
- Safety net: auto-test on push
- Branch previews for review
- Lighthouse tracking over time

## GitHub Actions Workflow
### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '22' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - run: npx @biomejs/biome check src/
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npx playwright test
        env:
          PROD_URL: ${{ secrets.PROD_URL }}

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '22' }
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare
        run: npx wrangler deploy
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
      - name: Purge Cache
        run: |
          curl -s -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${{ secrets.CF_ZONE_ID }}/purge_cache" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}" \
            --data '{"purge_everything":true}'

  lighthouse:
    needs: deploy
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: treosh/lighthouse-ci-action@v12
        with:
          urls: ${{ secrets.PROD_URL }}
          uploadArtifacts: true
```

## Required GitHub Secrets
```
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN — Wrangler deploy token
CF_ZONE_ID — For cache purge
PROD_URL — https://domain.com
```

Set via: `gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN --body "..."` or through GitHub UI.

## Branch Preview Deploys (Optional)
```yaml
  preview:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '22' }
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Deploy Preview
        run: npx wrangler deploy --env preview
        env:
          CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
      - name: Comment PR with preview URL
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              body: '🚀 Preview deployed: https://preview.domain.com'
            });
```

## Deployment Verification Patterns
### Post-Deploy Smoke Test (run after `wrangler deploy` in CI)
```yaml
  verify:
    needs: deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '22' }
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - name: Wait for edge propagation
        run: sleep 5
      - name: Smoke test production
        run: |
          npx playwright test tests/smoke.spec.ts
        env:
          PROD_URL: ${{ secrets.PROD_URL }}
      - name: Check health endpoint
        run: |
          STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "${{ secrets.PROD_URL }}/health")
          if [ "$STATUS" != "200" ]; then
            echo "Health check failed with status $STATUS"
            exit 1
          fi
```

### PR Check Workflow (gate merges on quality)
```yaml
  pr-checks:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: '22' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - run: npx vitest run --coverage
      - name: Playwright E2E
        run: npx playwright test
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## Computer Use Integration
Use `mcp__computer-use__*` for debugging CI failures visually:

1. **GitHub Actions UI** — Screenshot the Actions tab to see failed job steps when log parsing is insufficient
2. **Preview deploy verification** — Open the preview URL and screenshot at multiple viewports to verify the deploy looks correct before merging
3. **Cloudflare dashboard** — Screenshot Workers & Pages dashboard to verify deployment status and error rates

## Acceptance Criteria
| # | Criterion | Measurement |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | CI runs on every push to main | GitHub Actions shows a workflow run for every main branch commit |
| 2 | CI runs on every PR | PRs show check status (pass/fail) before merge |
| 3 | TypeScript compilation passes | `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0 in CI |
| 4 | E2E tests pass in CI | Playwright test job exits 0, report artifact uploaded |
| 5 | Deploy only happens on main push | Deploy job has correct `if` condition, no deploy on PRs |
| 6 | Lighthouse score tracked | Lighthouse CI job runs on main, scores uploaded as artifacts |
| 7 | Health endpoint verified post-deploy | Smoke test confirms `/health` returns 200 |
| 8 | Preview deploys comment on PR | PR has a bot comment with preview URL |
| 9 | Secrets configured | `gh secret list` shows CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, CF_ZONE_ID, PROD_URL |
| 10 | Failed CI blocks merge | Branch protection requires CI to pass before merge is allowed |
