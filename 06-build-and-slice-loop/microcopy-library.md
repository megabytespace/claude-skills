name: "Microcopy Library"
description: "Canonical brand-voice microcopy dictionary. Eliminates generic AI copy ('An error occurred', 'Submit', 'Loading...') with punchy, irreverent, on-brand alternatives. Covers buttons, errors, empty states, loading, success, tooltips, forms, confirmations, 404, and auth flows."

# Microcopy Library

Brand-voice microcopy for every UI surface. Flesch>=60, active voice, no "please," no corporate tone. Irreverent but professional. Every string must feel like a human wrote it, not a framework.

## Usage Rules

1. **Never use generic framework defaults.** Every user-facing string must come from this dictionary or match its tone.
2. **Contractions always.** "You're" not "You are." "It's" not "It is." "Can't" not "Cannot."
3. **No "please."** Direct without being rude. "Enter your email" not "Please enter your email."
4. **No exclamation marks on errors.** Save excitement for success states only.
5. **Template variables** use `{{variable}}` syntax. Keep them minimal — one per string max.
6. **Sentence case everywhere.** "Save your changes" not "Save Your Changes." Exception: product names, proper nouns.
7. **Max length:** Buttons 20 chars. Tooltips 60 chars. Errors 80 chars. Empty states 60 chars.
8. **Test readability:** If you'd cringe reading it aloud, rewrite it.

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// src/lib/microcopy.ts
const copy = {
  buttons: { submit: "Let's go", cancel: 'Nope, go back', save: 'Save it' },
  errors: { generic: "Something broke. We're on it.", network: 'Lost connection. Check your internet and retry.' },
  empty: { generic: 'Nothing here yet. Create your first one?' },
  loading: { generic: 'Hang tight...' },
  success: { generic: 'Done. Nailed it.' },
} as const;

type CopyKey = keyof typeof copy;
type SubKey<K extends CopyKey> = keyof (typeof copy)[K];

function t<K extends CopyKey>(category: K, key: SubKey<K>, vars?: Record<string, string>): string {
  let text = copy[category][key] as string;
  if (vars) {
    for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(vars)) {
      text = text.replace(`{{${k}}}`, v);
    }
  }
  return text;
}

export { copy, t };
```

## Angular Integration

```typescript
// In components, use the t() function directly:
import { t } from '../lib/microcopy';

@Component({
  template: `<button (click)="save()">{{ saveLabel }}</button>`,
})
export class SaveComponent {
  saveLabel = t('buttons', 'save');
}
```
