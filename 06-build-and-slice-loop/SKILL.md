# 06 — Build and Slice Loop

> Implement in vertical slices. Ship working increments. Never write placeholder code.

---

## Core Principle

**Every implementation increment must deliver visible, testable, end-to-end value.** No horizontal layers. No stubs. No "coming soon." Each slice cuts through the full stack — from database to UI — and works when it's done.

### Strategic Slice Priorities
Every slice should advance at least one of these goals:
1. **End-user value** — does this slice make the user's life tangibly better?
2. **Conversion psychology** — does this slice move users toward purchase/action? (04/wisdom)
3. **Brand quality** — does this slice make projectsites.dev look world-class?

### AI-Enriched Slices
Every slice should ask: "Can AI make this better?"
- Static images → AI-generated images (GPT Image 1.5, Ideogram)
- Manual text → AI-generated alt text, meta descriptions, translations
- Basic search → AI-powered semantic search (Vectorize + Workers AI)
- Generic recommendations → AI-driven personalization
- Manual support → AI chat widget (Workers AI RAG, 06/ai-chat)
- No video → AI-generated hero video (Sora 2, skill 12)

---

## Vertical Slice Rules

### What Makes a Good Slice
- Touches all relevant layers (data → API → UI)
- Produces a visible, testable result
- Can be deployed and verified independently
- Is the smallest unit that delivers real value
- Has clear acceptance criteria

### What Makes a Bad Slice
- "Set up the database" (horizontal layer)
- "Build the component library" (premature abstraction)
- "Add error handling everywhere" (cross-cutting without features)
- "Scaffold the project" (infrastructure without value)

### Slice Sequencing
```
Slice 1: Homepage with real content, working navigation, deployed
Slice 2: Core feature #1, end-to-end, tested
Slice 3: Core feature #2, end-to-end, tested
Slice N: Polish, edge cases, documentation
```

### First Slice Is Always the Homepage
Unless explicitly directed otherwise, the first vertical slice is:
1. A complete, beautiful homepage
2. With real content (not lorem ipsum)
3. With real images (generated or sourced)
4. With working navigation
5. Deployed to production
6. Verified with Playwright

---

## Anti-Placeholder Rules

### Never Ship
- `// TODO: implement this`
- `Lorem ipsum` or placeholder text
- Gray boxes instead of images
- `console.log('not implemented')`
- Empty pages behind navigation links
- Broken links to unbuilt pages
- Form submissions that go nowhere
- Buttons that don't work

### Instead
- Implement the real thing, even if minimal
- Use real copy (infer from product type if not provided)
- Generate or source real images
- Build working interactions
- If a page isn't ready, don't link to it
- If a form isn't wired up, make it capture to KV or D1
- "Coming soon" badges are DEFECTS, not placeholders — they are unfinished features shipped to production. Remove them by implementing the real feature or removing the section entirely.

---

## Implementation Patterns

### New Project Bootstrap
```
1. Create wrangler.toml with project name from domain
2. Create src/index.ts with Hono app
3. Build first page with full HTML (not template)
4. Add real CSS (not a framework default)
5. Add real content (infer from domain/product type)
6. Generate logo and favicon set
7. Add structured data (JSON-LD)
8. Add meta tags (OG, Twitter, canonical)
9. Add analytics snippet
10. Deploy and verify
→ Then build features in slices
```

### Feature Implementation Pattern
```
1. Write the E2E test first (what should the user see?)
2. Build the data layer (Drizzle schema + migration — 05/drizzle)
3. Build the API endpoint (Hono route, Zod validation)
4. Build the UI (page or component)
5. Wire everything together
6. Run the test
7. Fix until green
8. Deploy and verify live
```

### Parallel Implementation
When multiple features are independent:
```
Agent 1: Feature A (data → API → UI → test)
Agent 2: Feature B (data → API → UI → test)
Agent 3: Media generation (logo, hero, section images)
Agent 4: Analytics and observability setup
→ Merge when all complete
→ Integration test
→ Deploy
```

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Strictness
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true
  }
}
```

### Validation
- All external input validated with Zod at the boundary
- API request bodies: Zod schema
- URL parameters: Zod schema
- Environment variables: Zod schema at Worker start
- Never trust client data inside the Worker

### Error Handling
- Meaningful error messages (not "something went wrong")
- Consistent error envelope: `{ error: string, code?: string, details?: unknown }`
- Log errors with context (method, path, user ID if available)
- Never expose stack traces to clients
- Report to Sentry in production

### File Organization (Worker)
```
src/
├── index.ts          # Hono app entry, routes
├── routes/           # Route handlers by domain
│   ├── api.ts
│   └── pages.ts
├── middleware/        # Auth, CORS, rate limiting
├── services/         # Business logic
├── db/               # Schema, migrations, queries
├── lib/              # Shared utilities
├── types.ts          # Shared types
└── env.ts            # Zod env validation
```

### File Organization (Angular + Nx)
```
apps/
├── web/              # Angular app
│   └── src/
│       ├── app/
│       │   ├── pages/

    └── src/
packages/
├── shared/           # Zod schemas, types, utils
└── ui/               # Shared Angular components
```

---

## Content Generation Rules

### Real Copy
- Infer headlines from product type and domain
- Write benefit-oriented subheadings
- Use specific, concrete language (not generic marketing)
- Include social proof (even templated: "Trusted by X developers")
- Include clear CTAs with specific actions

### Real Images
- Generate hero images via imagegen or Sora
- Source stock from Unsplash/Pexels for supporting images
- Generate logos via Ideogram
- Create social preview images (OG)
- Compress all images (WebP, appropriate dimensions)

### Structured Data
Every page gets relevant JSON-LD:
- `Organization` — on all pages
- `WebSite` — on homepage
- `WebPage` — on every page
- `FAQPage` — if FAQ section exists
- `Product` — if selling something
- `SoftwareApplication` — if it's a tool
- `BreadcrumbList` — on subpages

[ ] Responsive (1280px + 375px)
[ ] Accessible (keyboard, screen reader, contrast)
[ ] Performance acceptable (< 3s LCP)
[ ] Error states handled
[ ] Loading states present
[ ] Empty states designed (new/zero-data views show helpful CTAs, not blank space)
[ ] Transactional emails implemented (confirmation, receipt, notification — not just the UI)

---

## Completeness Guarantee (verify EVERY feature against this full-stack checklist)

Before marking ANY feature slice as "done," verify every layer. Incomplete slices compound into broken products. This checklist is the rubber-duck test — if you can't check every box, the feature is not finished.

```
[ ] Data layer complete     — Drizzle schema defined, migration runs clean, seed data if needed
[ ] API endpoint complete   — Hono route implemented, Zod validation on all inputs, error envelope returned
[ ] UI complete             — HTML rendered, CSS styled, all interactions wired, empty/loading/error states handled
[ ] Tests complete          — E2E test for happy path + error path, form matrix (8 tests) if form exists
[ ] SEO complete            — Page has unique title, meta description, H1, JSON-LD, OG tags, canonical URL
[ ] Analytics complete      — PostHog event fires on key actions (page view, form submit, CTA click, purchase)
[ ] Error handling complete — Loading spinners, error messages (specific, not generic), empty states with helpful CTAs, 404/500 branded pages
[ ] Mobile complete         — No horizontal overflow at 375px, touch targets >= 44px, text readable without zoom
[ ] Docs complete           — JSDoc on exported functions, code comments explain WHY not WHAT, CLAUDE.md updated
```

### Strict TDD Workflow (MANDATORY — from Skill 01)
Every feature slice follows Red → Green → Refactor → Verify:
1. Write a Spec (Given/When/Then acceptance criteria)
2. Write a failing Playwright E2E test based on the spec
3. Run it — confirm it fails (Red)
4. Implement the minimum code to make it pass (Green)
5. Refactor while keeping tests green
6. Run FCE scan — zero findings required
7. Run 07/completeness visual verification — verified required
8. Deploy — only after all gates pass

### Continuous Self-Healing
When an E2E test fails during implementation:
1. Read the FULL error (not just the first line)
2. Diagnose root cause
3. Fix the code
4. Re-run the test
5. Loop until green (max 5 attempts)
6. NEVER skip a failing test or mark it .skip

### Self-Verification (Rubber Duck Gate)
Before moving to the next slice, explain the completed feature in one sentence: "A user can [action] which [result] because [implementation]." If any part of that sentence is vague, the slice is incomplete. This forced self-explanation catches gaps that code reviews miss (source: GitHub Rubber Duck pattern, April 2026).

## Rapid Start Protocol (New Project in < 5 minutes)

When a new project folder is empty, get to first deploy in under 5 minutes:

```
Minute 0-1: Infer product type from domain → load SKILL_PROFILES.md profile
Minute 1-2: Generate wrangler.toml + src/index.ts with Hono from CONVENTIONS.md starter
Minute 2-3: Build homepage HTML with real inferred content + meta tags + JSON-LD
Minute 3-4: Add CSS (brand tokens from CONVENTIONS.md), favicon placeholder
Minute 4-5: wrangler deploy → purge cache → verify 200 OK
```

This gives you a live URL in 5 minutes. Then iterate with features.

**Parallel at minute 2:** Launch media agent (logo gen via Ideogram, hero via GPT Image).
**Parallel at minute 3:** Launch content agent (keyword research, copy writing).

## Reuse Index (check before building)

Before implementing any feature, check if it already exists in another emdash project:
```
~/emdash-projects/*/src/                  # Source code
~/emdash-projects/*/e2e/                  # Test patterns
~/emdash-projects/*/wrangler.toml         # Config patterns
```

Common reusable patterns across projects:
- Contact form with Turnstile (06/contact-forms template)
- Stripe checkout session (13/stripe-billing template)
- Clerk auth middleware (skill 05 pattern)
- Error pages (06/custom-error-pages template)
- Analytics setup (skill 13 pattern)
- CSP headers (CONVENTIONS.md)

**Copy and adapt instead of writing from scratch.** The AI advantage is speed through reuse.
