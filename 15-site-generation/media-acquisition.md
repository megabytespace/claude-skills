# Media Acquisition

Collect 10x more assets than needed, curate down via AI visual inspection. A 4-page site needs ***30-50 high-quality images + 3-5 videos + 1 logo + 5-10 AI-generated originals*** minimum. The site must feel media-rich and immersive from the first scroll. Every site MUST have a logo and favicon set. Users should feel like a professional agency spent weeks curating this content.

**Budget split:** GPT-4o vision QA capped at $1 (see completeness-verification). Media generation/acquisition is a SEPARATE budget — spend what's needed to make the site gorgeous. Ideogram (~$0.05/logo), GPT Image 1.5 (~$0.04/image), Stability (~$0.03/image), stock APIs (free tiers). Typical media budget: $0.50-2.00/site. This is GOOD spend — it creates the content that makes sites convert.

## Image Search Queries

Per business: construct 3-5 search queries combining: business type + city, business name + storefront, business type + interior, specific services + professional. Example for "Vito's Mens Salon, Lake Hiawatha NJ": `["mens salon interior modern", "barber shop Lake Hiawatha NJ", "men haircut professional", "salon storefront exterior"]`.

## Logo Discovery (***NON-NEGOTIABLE — every site needs a logo***)

Priority: 1. User upload 2. Scrape from existing site header/footer/og:image 3. Logo.dev (`LOGODEV_TOKEN`) 4. Brandfetch (`BRANDFETCH_API_KEY`) 5. Google favicon API 6. AI-generate as LAST resort.

**Logo font extraction:** When logo found, use GPT-4o vision to identify the font → reuse in site design. Logo graphic elements and colors influence ENTIRE site design.

**AI logo generation (if none found):** Ideogram v3 preferred for text-heavy logos. Generate exactly 3 variants: A=lockup, B=icon, C=wordmark. Single GPT-4o detail:low call rates all 3 (1-10), picks winner. Winner <7: regenerate losing slot only (max 2 rounds). Cost: ~$0.05 total. Style: clean, modern, text-based with geometric accent. Brand colors + bold display font.

## Favicon Set (from logo)

From winning logo: `magick logo.png -fuzz 15% -trim +repage` then: 512x512 (android-chrome), 192x192 (android-chrome), 180x180 (apple-touch-icon), 32x32, 16x16, multi-size .ico (16+32+48). site.webmanifest with 192+512 refs. browserconfig.xml for MS tile. Head tags for all sizes.

**In-container alternative** (no ImageMagick): `buildPngIco()` — manual ICO construction: 6-byte header + 16-byte directory entry + raw PNG bytes. Width/height 0 (=256+), 32-bit, offset 22. Store full PNG as favicon.ico (browsers handle it).

## AI-Generated Original Content (***AGGRESSIVE — EVERY SITE***)

Generate originals when stock/discovered images are insufficient or generic. Originals make the site feel bespoke.

| Type | API | Use Case | Cost |
|------|-----|----------|------|
| Hero backgrounds | GPT Image 1.5 | Abstract brand-colored scenes, atmospheric gradients with depth | ~$0.04 |
| Service illustrations | GPT Image 1.5 | Custom illustrations per service offered | ~$0.04 |
| Section dividers | Stability AI | Geometric patterns, brand-colored abstract art | ~$0.03 |
| Texture overlays | Stability AI | Noise, grain, mesh gradients for glassmorphism | ~$0.03 |
| Team/about imagery | GPT Image 1.5 | Workplace scenes matching business type (NOT fake headshots) | ~$0.04 |
| Logo + variants | Ideogram v3 | A=lockup, B=icon, C=wordmark | ~$0.05 |
| OG preview image | GPT Image 1.5 | 1200x630 social share card with brand + business name | ~$0.04 |
| Icon set | Ideogram v3 | Custom service icons matching brand style (if generic Lucide insufficient) | ~$0.05 |

**Generation strategy:** Generate 3-5 hero candidates, 1 per service, 2-3 atmospheric textures, 1 OG image. Pick best via GPT-4o detail:low (single batch call, all candidates in one request). Total generation: ~$0.30-0.50. Combined with logo A/B/C: ~$0.35-0.55 generation spend.

**Prompt patterns for GPT Image 1.5:**
- Hero: "Cinematic wide shot, {business_type} environment, {brand_primary} and {brand_secondary} color palette, dramatic lighting, professional photography style, no text, no people, 16:9"
- Service: "Clean modern illustration of {service_name}, {brand_colors}, minimal style, white/dark background, professional"
- Texture: "Abstract geometric pattern, {brand_primary} gradients, subtle depth, seamless tileable, dark background"

## Video Discovery (***3-5 VIDEOS MINIMUM***)

YouTube Data API (`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`): search business name + city → top 3 results. Search business type + "professional" → 2 more. Pexels Video API (`PEXELS_API_KEY`): search business type for B-roll (3-5 clips). Store as video manifest JSON (URL, thumbnail, duration, title) — not downloaded. Embed via YouTube iframe or Pexels player.

**Video placement strategy:** Hero background (muted autoplay 4-8s loop from Pexels), services section (YouTube embed if business has channel), about section (B-roll montage), testimonials (video reviews if available). Every page should have at least one video or animated element.

## Image Profiling (***COST-TIERED***)

**Tier 1 — Workers AI Llama Vision (FREE):** Profile ALL images: description, keywords (3-5), quality_score (1-10), relevance_score (1-10), suggested_placement, alt_text, dominant_colors (3-5 hex). Batch 5 images/call, 3 batches parallel. Sufficient for 90% of placement decisions.

**Tier 2 — GPT-4o detail:low (~$0.02):** Top 5 hero candidates only (sorted by Tier 1 combined score). Single batch call. Picks final hero, validates brand color extraction, confirms quality for above-the-fold placement.

Reject: quality <5, relevance <4, watermarks, inappropriate content, <1000 bytes (tracking pixels), >10MB. Store profiles as `_image_profiles.json`. Claude Code reads this to know which image goes where.

## Image Storage

R2 path: `sites/{slug}/assets/discovered/{safeName}-{confidence}pct.{ext}`. Custom metadata: source, confidence, originalUrl. User uploads: `sites/{slug}/assets/uploaded/`. Generated: `sites/{slug}/assets/generated/`. Logo: `sites/{slug}/assets/logo.png`.

## Media for Different Site Types

**SaaS:** Product screenshots (Playwright on demo), feature illustrations (GPT Image 1.5), integration partner logos, abstract hero (gradient mesh or 3D), team photos.

**Portfolio:** Project screenshots/photos are THE content. High-res, properly cropped. Before/after comparisons. Process photos. Client headshots for testimonials.

**Restaurant:** Food photography is critical. Google Places photos, Yelp photos, menu item images. Interior ambiance shots. Chef/team photos. Prioritize appetizing, well-lit food images.

**Non-profit:** Impact photos (people helped, events), team/volunteer photos, partner logos, infographic-style impact stats. Warm, dignified — never poverty tourism.

**Real estate:** Property photos, neighborhood shots, market data visualizations. Virtual tour links. Agent headshots.

## Placeholder Strategy

If insufficient images: CSS gradients as backgrounds (never stock photos as placeholders). Gradient patterns: `linear-gradient(135deg, {brand_primary}22, {brand_secondary}11)`. SVG abstract patterns generated from brand colors. Never leave empty image slots — either fill with real content or use branded gradient.

## Performance Budget

Total images <500KB compressed. Largest single image <200KB. Hero: eager+preload+fetchpriority=high. Below fold: lazy+decoding=async. Prefer WebP (CF Image Transforms format=auto). srcset: 320/640/1280/1920w. Inline SVGs <2KB each.
