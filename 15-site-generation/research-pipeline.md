# Research Pipeline

All research runs on the Worker (not in the container). Results are written as `_` prefixed JSON files into the build directory. Claude Code reads these — never calls APIs for research.

## Phase 0a: Business Profile (Google Places API)

Query: `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` → `findplacefromtext` with business name + address. Then `place/details` for: name, formatted_address, formatted_phone_number, opening_hours, website, rating, user_ratings_total, reviews (top 3), photos (download to R2), geometry (lat/lng), types, price_level, business_status. Confidence: google_places source at 80-95 depending on field.

Fallback chain: 1. Yelp Fusion API (`YELP_API_KEY`) — business match by name+location, returns reviews/photos/hours/categories (confidence 60-80). 2. Facebook Graph API — page search by business name, returns about/hours/phone/address (confidence 55-70). 3. BBB API/scrape — search by business name, returns rating/accreditation/complaints (confidence 70-85, trust signal). 4. Workers AI (Llama 3.3 70b) research prompt — synthesize from web search results (confidence 50-70, LAST RESORT).

**Competitor analysis (auto, no extra API cost):** Google Places `nearbysearch` with same `type` within 5mi radius. Top 5 competitors: extract names, ratings, review counts, websites. Used in build prompt for differentiation ("You have 4.8 stars vs competitors averaging 4.2 — emphasize this").

## Phase 0b: Website Scraping (Deep Crawl)

If business has existing website: crawl up to 50 pages (was 20 — content-rich sites need full migration). For each: extract title, headings, body text, images (download to R2), nav structure, footer content, meta tags, schema.org data. Store as `_scraped_content.json` keyed by URL path. Extract: all text content for reuse, all image URLs for download, sitemap structure for page recreation, blog posts for content migration.

**Sitemap fetch (***CRITICAL FOR URL PRESERVATION***):** Before crawling, fetch `/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap_index.xml`. Parse all `<loc>` URLs into `_scraped_content.json.sitemap_urls[]`. These become the canonical list of URLs that must resolve (200 or 301) on the new site. If no sitemap exists, build the URL list from crawled pages + any links discovered. Store as `_original_urls: string[]` in `_scraped_content.json`.

Tools: `fetch()` with CF Workers (no Puppeteer needed for static sites). For JS-rendered: use `@cloudflare/puppeteer` or skip with graceful degradation. Parse HTML with regex patterns (no DOM parser in Worker).

## Phase 0c: Social Media Verification

For each platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest, Yelp, Google Business): construct candidate URL from business name → HEAD request → verify 200 status. Only include URLs at 90%+ confidence. Dead links: exclude entirely.

## Phase 0d: Brand Extraction (***PRIMARY COLOR RETRIEVAL***)

Priority order for primary color: logo dominant color → header/nav background → CTA button color → accent borders → hero overlay. Extract via: 1. Brandfetch API (`BRANDFETCH_API_KEY`) — returns full brand kit (colors, fonts, logos) at 90% confidence. 2. Logo.dev API (`LOGODEV_TOKEN`) — logo image → GPT-4o vision extracts dominant colors. 3. GPT-4o vision on screenshot of existing site. 4. Color extraction from downloaded images in assets/ (look for signage, storefront, uniforms).

**Output to `_brand.json`:**
```json
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": { "value": "#8B1A2B", "source": "extracted_from_logo", "confidence": 0.92 },
    "secondary": { "value": "#1A1A2E", "source": "extracted_from_website", "confidence": 0.85 },
    "accent": { "value": "#E8B931", "source": "extracted_from_website", "confidence": 0.80 },
    "background": { "value": "#0D0D1A", "source": "derived_from_primary", "confidence": 0.88 },
    "foreground": { "value": "#F5F5F5", "source": "contrast_calculated", "confidence": 0.95 }
  },
  "fonts": { "heading": "Playfair Display", "body": "Inter", "source": "extracted_from_website" },
  "personality": "professional",
  "logo_url": "assets/logo.svg"
}
```

**Color source tracking (***CRITICAL***):** Every color must have `color_source`: extracted_from_logo|extracted_from_website|extracted_from_assets|derived_from_primary|contrast_calculated|generated. NEVER guess colors from business category. The njsk.org burgundy incident: system guessed "warm soup kitchen colors" instead of extracting their actual burgundy brand. `background` is derived by darkening primary by 80-90% lightness in OKLCH. `foreground` is calculated for WCAG AA contrast against background.

**New business fallback (no web presence):** If business has no website, no logo, and no social media: 1. Google Places photos → extract dominant color from storefront/signage images. 2. Google Street View screenshot → extract from building facade, awning, signage. 3. Industry-neutral defaults as LAST RESORT: primary=#2563EB (accessible blue), secondary=#1E293B (slate), accent=#F59E0B (amber). Mark `color_source: "fallback_default"` with confidence 0.40. Flag in `_brand.json.warnings[]`: "No brand assets found — using neutral defaults. Business owner should provide logo/colors." NEVER skip to category-based guessing.

## Phase 0e: Confidence Scoring

Every data point gets `Conf<T>`: `{ value: T, confidence: number (0-1), sources: Source[], apa_citation: string, source_url: string, refId: string }`. Source types: google_places, llm_inference, user_provided, web_scrape, social_verify, peer_reviewed, gov_edu, primary_data, industry_research. Merge rule: higher confidence wins, corroboration boosts +0.1 (capped at 0.99). UI policy: prominent >=0.85, standard 0.70-0.84, deemphasize 0.50-0.69, hide <0.50.

**APA citation requirement (***NON-NEGOTIABLE — see rules/citations.md***):** every quantitative field (%, N, $, ratio, comparison, year-claim) MUST carry `apa_citation` (APA 7th ed) and `source_url`. Examples: `apa_citation: "U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2024). Occupational employment statistics: Restaurant industry. https://www.bls.gov/oes/"` or `apa_citation: "Brewer, S. (2024). AI search citation rates. Journal of Search Engine Optimization, 15(2), 88-104. https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx"`. Confidence>=0.85 requires 2+ corroborating cites; single source=0.70; unsourced=rejected.

Warnings generated for missing: phone (<0.5), email (<0.5), geo (<0.3), booking_url (<0.5), reviews (<0.3), apa_citation on any quantitative claim (auto-fail).

## Phase 0g: Citation Aggregation (`_citations.json`)

Sibling file to `_research.json`. APA 7th ed bibliography keyed by `refId`. Schema:
```json
{
  "ref-1": {
    "type": "journal|web|government|industry|primary",
    "authors": ["Brewer, S.", "Lee, M."],
    "year": 2024,
    "title": "AI search citation rates with structured data",
    "publication": "Journal of Search Engine Optimization",
    "volume": "15(2)",
    "pages": "88-104",
    "doi": "10.xxxx/xxxxx",
    "url": "https://...",
    "accessed": "2026-04-25",
    "apa_formatted": "Brewer, S., & Lee, M. (2024). AI search citation rates with structured data. Journal of Search Engine Optimization, 15(2), 88-104. https://doi.org/10.xxxx/xxxxx"
  }
}
```
Container script `~/format-citations.js` (citation-js npm) converts BibTeX/RIS/CSL-JSON → APA 7th. Write `_citations.json` during research phase. Components reference by `refId`. Build gate `validate-citations.js` ensures every numeric claim in dist/ HTML resolves to a `refId` entry.

## Phase 0f: Enrichment Sources

## Research for Different Site Types

**SaaS sites:** Skip Google Places. Research: competitor features (web search), pricing benchmarks, integration ecosystems, trust signals (G2/Capterra ratings), tech stack indicators. Scrape: landing pages, pricing pages, docs, changelog.

**Portfolio sites:** Minimal API research. Focus on: scraping all project/work pages, extracting case study content, downloading project images, identifying skills/tech mentioned. Client list from testimonials.

**Non-profit:** Google Places + IRS 990 data (if available). Research: mission statement, impact metrics, volunteer programs, donation platforms, event calendars, partner organizations. Scrape all pages — non-profits often have 20+ pages of valuable content to reorganize.

**Government/institutional:** Deep scrape required (often 100+ pages). Organize by user intent not org structure. Extract: services offered, contact directories, document libraries, news/press releases, policy documents.
