# Quality Gates

## Visual Inspection (MANDATORY — ***COST-TIERED***)

**In-container `inspect.js`:** Takes HTML file path → sends first 14KB to vision model. Persona: "senior Stripe web designer." 8 scoring categories: color contrast, typography, layout/spacing, animations, images, mobile responsiveness, brand consistency, visual polish vs generic AI look. Scale 1-10.

**Tiered model selection:**
- **Draft rounds (1-2):** Workers AI Llama Vision (FREE) — catches layout breaks, missing elements, broken images, contrast failures. Sufficient for 80% of issues.
- **Final round (homepage only):** GPT-4o detail:low (~$0.02) — catches aesthetic nuance, brand harmony, "does it feel premium?" Only if Workers AI round scores ≥7 (no point polishing a broken layout).

**In-container loop:** After `npm run build`, run `node /home/cuser/inspect.js dist/index.html`. If score <8: fix → rebuild → re-inspect. Max 3 iterations. Workers AI for rounds 1-2, GPT-4o for final homepage check only.

**Post-deploy inspection:** Worker screenshots via `microlink.io` API → Workers AI Llama Vision for all pages → GPT-4o detail:low for homepage ATF only → logs score + issues to D1 audit_logs.

## 10-Dimension Quality Scoring

| Dimension | Min | What |
|-----------|-----|------|
| visual_design | 0.85 | Layout balance, whitespace, color harmony, depth, animations |
| content_quality | 0.85 | Real content, no placeholder, accurate, comprehensive |
| completeness | 0.85 | All sections present, all images used, all pages linked |
| responsiveness | 0.85 | 375/768/1024px clean, no overflow, touch targets >=44px |
| accessibility | 0.85 | WCAG AA contrast, heading hierarchy, alt text, ARIA, skip link |
| seo | 0.85 | JSON-LD, meta, canonical, OG, sitemap, keyword placement |
| performance | 0.85 | <100KB HTML, lazy images, font preconnect, no render blocking |
| brand_consistency | 0.85 | Matches research colors/fonts, logo prominent, NAP consistent |
| media_richness | 0.85 | 30+ unique images, 3-5 videos, no broken, no duplicates, proper sizing |
| text_contrast | 0.85 | 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text, no washed-out combinations |

Overall must exceed 0.90 to auto-publish. Below 0.85 any dimension → fix required.

- ARIA roles on custom widgets only (semantic HTML preferred)

## Criticism Registry (evolving rules)

Universal rules applied to ALL generated sites:

**Color & Contrast:** Never use washed-out, muddy, or generic palettes. Brand colors enhanced for vibrancy if needed while keeping hue family. Every text/background combo checked for WCAG AA. Dark overlays on image-backed text sections.

**Typography:** Consistent font-weight hierarchy. Hero headlines max 8 words. Section labels consistent case. Button text uses action verbs. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent everywhere.

**Images:** No broken images (naturalWidth > 0). No duplicate images. All images lazy except hero. Proper width/height/aspect-ratio. Loading shimmer placeholders. Every image in assets/ used somewhere.

**Layout:** No horizontal scroll at 375px. All text readable at 375px (min 14px). Consistent card grid alignment. No orphaned sections. Full-width on mobile, max-width on desktop.

**Brand:** Logo in every page header. Brand colors dominate, not generic Tailwind defaults. Font from logo/brand research used throughout. Favicon set present.

**Content:** No lorem ipsum. No TODO stubs. No "Coming Soon" pages. Copyright year current. Footer has Privacy + Terms links. Contact info matches research data exactly.

**Performance:** HTML under 100KB. No console.log. No render-blocking scripts. Fonts preconnected. Smooth scroll (no jarring jumps). Back-to-top button.

**Safety:** No inappropriate content. Privacy notice on forms. Footer compliance links. rel="noopener noreferrer" on external links. COPPA compliance if child-facing. ProjectSites.dev attribution in FAQ.

**Animation & Motion (skill 11):** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` on ALL @keyframes and transitions. View Transitions API with `@supports` gate. `@starting-style` for modal/toast entry. No animation longer than 300ms. Parallax only via `animation-timeline: scroll()` (off main thread).

**Core Web Vitals (***NON-NEGOTIABLE***):** LCP <= 2.5s (hero image preloaded, `fetchpriority="high"`). CLS <= 0.1 (all images have width/height/aspect-ratio). INP <= 200ms (no blocking event handlers). Fonts preconnected + `font-display:swap`. CSS `<link>` in `<head>`, JS deferred.

**Image Optimization (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every image in assets/ must have WebP+AVIF variants at 320/640/1280/1920w. No raw PNG/JPG served to browser. `<picture>` with srcset on all `<img>` elements. Blur placeholder (base64) on below-fold images. Hero: eager+preload+fetchpriority=high. Max single image: 200KB optimized. Total page: <500KB images. Verify: no `<img src="*.jpg">` or `<img src="*.png">` in dist/ HTML (must be inside `<picture>` with WebP source).

**Offline Capability:** Service worker registered in production. After build: simulate offline in DevTools → verify site loads from cache. Contact info (phone, address, hours) available offline. Gallery images cached. Analytics gracefully degrade (no errors when offline).

**Analytics Verification:** PostHog snippet present with `persistence:'memory'`. GTM container snippet in head + noscript. Local conversion events wired: `tel:` → phone_click, Maps → direction_click, form → form_submit. Verify all three fire on page load (PostHog, GA4, GTM).

**Structured Data Validation:** JSON-LD LocalBusiness with: @type, name, address (PostalAddress), telephone, geo (GeoCoordinates), openingHoursSpecification, image, sameAs[], aggregateRating (if reviews exist), priceRange, areaServed, hasMenu (restaurants). FAQPage schema on FAQ sections. BreadcrumbList on sub-pages. Validate with Google Rich Results Test.

**Cross-Browser:** Test in Chrome + Safari (80%+ local business visitors). Safari-specific: `-webkit-` prefixes for backdrop-filter, scroll-snap. No Firefox-only CSS features without fallback.

**Cookie Consent / GDPR:** If site targets EU: cookie banner with accept/reject. PostHog `persistence:'memory'` = no cookies (compliant by default). Google Analytics requires consent mode v2 (`gtag('consent', 'default', {analytics_storage:'denied'})` until accepted).

**NAP Consistency (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Name+Address+Phone must match EXACTLY across: site header, NAPFooter, JSON-LD LocalBusiness, Google Maps embed, contact page, `_gbp_sync.json`. Any divergence = build failure. Automated check in inspect.js: extract NAP from all sources, diff, fail if mismatch.

**Component Completeness:** All 16 local components must be available in template. Build prompt must reference: HeroWithPhoto, ServiceCards, TestimonialCarousel, MapEmbed, StickyPhoneCTA, NAPFooter, TrustBadges, ReviewCTA, GalleryGrid, BeforeAfterSlider, QuickActions, EmergencyBanner, SpeedDial, BookingEmbed, LocalSchemaGenerator, ResponsiveImage. Missing component = template drift.

**PWA Validation:** site.webmanifest present with correct name/icons/theme_color. Favicon set complete (ico+16+32+apple-touch+android-chrome 192+512). `<link rel="manifest">` in index.html.

**Print Stylesheet:** `@media print` rules present in index.css. Verify: nav/footer/sticky hidden, body white bg, link URLs printed.

**Service Area Pages (if applicable):** Each `/service-area/{city}` has unique H1, meta desc, localized content. No duplicate content across pages. All pages in sitemap.xml.

## Domain-Specific Quality Rules

**Restaurant:** Menu must have prices. Food photos must look appetizing (well-lit, styled). Hours prominently displayed. Online ordering CTA if platform exists.

**Salon/Barber:** Services with prices. Booking CTA prominent. Before/after gallery. Stylist profiles with photos.

**Medical:** Provider credentials displayed. HIPAA-compliant form language. Emergency info. Insurance accepted list.

**Legal:** Practice areas with descriptions. Attorney profiles with bar info. Free consultation CTA. Client testimonials with attribution.

**Non-profit:** Donation CTA in hero + footer + every page. Impact counters animated. Volunteer signup. 501(c)(3) status visible.

**SaaS:** Pricing tiers comparison. Free trial CTA. Integration logos. API docs link. Status page link. SOC2/GDPR badges if applicable.

## Generalization Principle

When any specific criticism is received about a generated site, it MUST be generalized into a rule that applies to ALL future builds. Example: "njsk.org colors are wrong" → "NEVER guess colors from business category; ALWAYS extract from logo/website." The criticism registry grows with every user feedback cycle.
