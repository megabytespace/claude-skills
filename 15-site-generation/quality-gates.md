# Quality Gates

## Visual Inspection (MANDATORY — ***COST-TIERED***)

**In-container `inspect.js`:** Takes HTML file path → sends first 14KB to vision model. Persona: "senior Stripe web designer." 8 scoring categories: color contrast, typography, layout/spacing, animations, images, mobile responsiveness, brand consistency, visual polish vs generic AI look. Scale 1-10.

**Tiered model selection:**
- **Draft rounds (1-2):** Workers AI Llama Vision (FREE) — catches layout breaks, missing elements, broken images, contrast failures. Sufficient for 80% of issues.
- **Final round (homepage only):** GPT-4o detail:low (~$0.02) — catches aesthetic nuance, brand harmony, "does it feel premium?" Only if Workers AI round scores ≥7 (no point polishing a broken layout).

**In-container loop:** After `npm run build`, run `node /home/cuser/inspect.js dist/index.html`. If score <8: fix → rebuild → re-inspect. Max 3 iterations. Workers AI for rounds 1-2, GPT-4o for final homepage check only.

**Post-deploy inspection:** Worker screenshots via `microlink.io` API → Workers AI Llama Vision for all pages → GPT-4o detail:low for homepage ATF only → logs score + issues to D1 audit_logs.

## 10-Dimension Quality Scoring

| Dimension | Min | What |
|-----------|-----|------|
| visual_design | 0.85 | Layout balance, whitespace, color harmony, depth, animations |
| content_quality | 0.85 | Real content, no placeholder, accurate, comprehensive |
| completeness | 0.85 | All sections present, all images used, all pages linked |
| responsiveness | 0.85 | 375/768/1024px clean, no overflow, touch targets >=44px |
| accessibility | 0.85 | WCAG AA contrast, heading hierarchy, alt text, ARIA, skip link |
| seo | 0.85 | JSON-LD, meta, canonical, OG, sitemap, keyword placement |
| performance | 0.85 | <100KB HTML, lazy images, font preconnect, no render blocking |
| brand_consistency | 0.85 | Matches research colors/fonts, logo prominent, NAP consistent |
| media_richness | 0.85 | 30+ unique images, 3-5 videos, no broken, no duplicates, proper sizing |
| text_contrast | 0.85 | 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text, no washed-out combinations |

Overall must exceed 0.90 to auto-publish. Below 0.85 any dimension → fix required.

- Focus-visible on all interactive elements
- Touch targets >=24px (WCAG 2.2 2.5.8)
- Focus appearance visible (2.4.11)
- Dragging alternatives (2.5.7) for any drag interactions
- ARIA roles on custom widgets only (semantic HTML preferred)

## Criticism Registry (evolving rules)

Universal rules applied to ALL generated sites:

**Color & Contrast:** Never use washed-out, muddy, or generic palettes. Brand colors enhanced for vibrancy if needed while keeping hue family. Every text/background combo checked for WCAG AA. Dark overlays on image-backed text sections.

**Typography:** Consistent font-weight hierarchy. Hero headlines max 8 words. Section labels consistent case. Button text uses action verbs. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistent everywhere.

**Images:** No broken images (naturalWidth > 0). No duplicate images. All images lazy except hero. Proper width/height/aspect-ratio. Loading shimmer placeholders. Every image in assets/ used somewhere.

**Layout:** No horizontal scroll at 375px. All text readable at 375px (min 14px). Consistent card grid alignment. No orphaned sections. Full-width on mobile, max-width on desktop.

**Brand:** Logo in every page header. Brand colors dominate, not generic Tailwind defaults. Font from logo/brand research used throughout. Favicon set present.

**Content:** No lorem ipsum. No TODO stubs. No "Coming Soon" pages. Copyright year current. Footer has Privacy + Terms links. Contact info matches research data exactly.

**Performance:** HTML under 100KB. No console.log. No render-blocking scripts. Fonts preconnected. Smooth scroll (no jarring jumps). Back-to-top button.

**Safety:** No inappropriate content. Privacy notice on forms. Footer compliance links. rel="noopener noreferrer" on external links. COPPA compliance if child-facing. ProjectSites.dev attribution in FAQ.

**Animation & Motion (skill 11):** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` on ALL @keyframes and transitions. View Transitions API with `@supports` gate. `@starting-style` for modal/toast entry. No animation longer than 300ms. Parallax only via `animation-timeline: scroll()` (off main thread).

**Core Web Vitals (***NON-NEGOTIABLE***):** LCP <= 2.5s (hero image preloaded, `fetchpriority="high"`). CLS <= 0.1 (all images have width/height/aspect-ratio). INP <= 200ms (no blocking event handlers). Fonts preconnected + `font-display:swap`. CSS `<link>` in `<head>`, JS deferred.

**Image Optimization (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every image in assets/ must have WebP+AVIF variants at 320/640/1280/1920w. No raw PNG/JPG served to browser. `<picture>` with srcset on all `<img>` elements. Blur placeholder (base64) on below-fold images. Hero: eager+preload+fetchpriority=high. Max single image: 200KB optimized. Total page: <500KB images. Verify: no `<img src="*.jpg">` or `<img src="*.png">` in dist/ HTML (must be inside `<picture>` with WebP source).

**Offline Capability:** Service worker registered in production. After build: simulate offline in DevTools → verify site loads from cache. Contact info (phone, address, hours) available offline. Gallery images cached. Analytics gracefully degrade (no errors when offline).

**Analytics Verification:** PostHog snippet present with `persistence:'memory'`. GTM container snippet in head + noscript. Local conversion events wired: `tel:` → phone_click, Maps → direction_click, form → form_submit. Verify all three fire on page load (PostHog, GA4, GTM).

**Structured Data Validation:** JSON-LD LocalBusiness with: @type, name, address (PostalAddress), telephone, geo (GeoCoordinates), openingHoursSpecification, image, sameAs[], aggregateRating (if reviews exist), priceRange, areaServed, hasMenu (restaurants). FAQPage schema on FAQ sections. BreadcrumbList on sub-pages. Validate with Google Rich Results Test.

**Cross-Browser:** Test in Chrome + Safari (80%+ local business visitors). Safari-specific: `-webkit-` prefixes for backdrop-filter, scroll-snap. No Firefox-only CSS features without fallback.

**Lightbox Coverage (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** `src/components/lightbox.tsx` MUST exist and be mounted in Layout. Every page with 4+ content images MUST include at least one `[data-gallery]` wrapper. Build gate: grep `dist/assets/*.js` for `data-zoomable` AND `data-gallery` strings — both required. Visual gate: Playwright opens 3 random pages, clicks 1st content image, asserts `[role="dialog"][aria-modal="true"]` appears within 200ms, presses `→`, asserts image src changes, presses `Esc`, asserts dialog removed. Audit checklist: prev/next buttons present when gallery has 2+ images|counter `n/total` visible|figcaption from alt text|44×44 close button|swipe gestures wired (Pointer Events listener)|`prefers-reduced-motion` disables scale|preload of neighbor images|focus-trap on modal-only.

**Asset Existence (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every `<img src>`, `<source srcset>`, `<link href>`, `<script src>`, `<video src>`, `<source src>`, `url(...)` in dist/ HTML+CSS must resolve to a file present in dist/ OR an allowed external host (https only, hostname in allowlist: googletagmanager.com, fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, www.google.com/maps/embed, microlink.io, posthog.com). Local refs (starting `/` or relative) checked against `find dist -type f`. Build gate: `node validate-assets.js dist/` — fail if any reference 404s. The megabyte-labs `/og-image.png` 404 incident (HTML referenced .png, R2 had .jpg) MUST never repeat.

**Image Format vs Size (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Any PNG over 200KB MUST be re-encoded to WebP (lossy q=85) or JPEG progressive (q=82) before R2 upload. Hero photos: WebP+AVIF variants at 1920/1280/640/320w. Logos: keep PNG only if <50KB transparent — otherwise SVG. OG cards: PNG OK at 1200×630 ≤100KB; if larger, re-encode to JPEG q=85. Build gate: `node validate-image-budgets.js dist/` — flag any single image >200KB, total images >500KB.

**OG Image Quality (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every site MUST ship `/og-image.png` (or .jpg) at exactly 1200×630, ≤100KB, branded card style: dark brand background, primary color accent bar, business name in display font, tagline below, logo bottom-right. NO scraped or stock photo as og-image — must be generated via Satori or DALL-E with brand colors. `<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">` + `og:image:height content="630"` mandatory. Twitter `summary_large_image` card mandatory.

**Apple Touch Icon (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** `/apple-touch-icon.png` at 180×180 mandatory at root, generated from logo. `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">` in every page head. Missing icon = build fails.

**Meta Description Strict (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every page meta description 120-156 chars HARD LIMIT. Title 50-60 chars HARD LIMIT. Build gate: `node validate-meta.js dist/**/index.html` — count chars (not bytes), fail if outside ranges. Pages without meta desc = fail.

**JSON-LD Count (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every page MUST include 4+ JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks. Required minimum: WebSite + Organization (or LocalBusiness) + WebPage + BreadcrumbList. Sub-pages add: Product (manufacturer), BlogPosting (blog post), FAQPage (faq page), Person (team member), Article (article page). Build gate: count `application/ld+json` in dist HTML, fail if <4 on any indexed page.

**H1 in HTML Shell (***BUILD-BREAKING — SEO***):** SPAs MUST prerender hero H1 + first paragraph + meta into the static `index.html` shell so crawlers see content without executing JS. Use `vite-plugin-prerender-spa` or static `<noscript>` fallback with H1 + business name + brief description. Build gate: `node validate-h1.js dist/index.html` — must find at least one `<h1>` in the raw HTML before any `<script>` tag executes.

**Sitemap lastmod (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Every `<url>` in `sitemap.xml` MUST include `<lastmod>YYYY-MM-DD</lastmod>` set to build timestamp. Missing lastmod = fail.

**color-scheme Meta (***DARK SITES***):** Sites with dark theme as primary MUST include `<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">` so browsers render scrollbars + form controls correctly without flash-of-light.

**JS Code-Splitting (***PERFORMANCE GATE***):** Vite config MUST include `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` splitting React core, UI lib, route bundles. Per-route chunks via `React.lazy()` for any page >50KB. Build gate: largest single .js chunk <250KB gz; total JS <500KB gz.

**DNS Prefetch + Font Preload (***PERFORMANCE — STANDARD***):** `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` + `<link rel="preconnect" crossorigin>` for fonts.googleapis.com, fonts.gstatic.com, www.google-analytics.com. `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>` for primary display + body font. Hero image: `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">`.

**Custom Hostname Canonical (***SEO***):** When projectsites.dev subdomain represents a real brand with custom domain potential or existing custom hostname, canonical URL MUST point to the custom domain (not the projectsites.dev URL) once domain provisioned. During pre-domain phase: canonical = projectsites.dev URL is acceptable.

**`tel:` in Nav for Local Business (***CONVERSION***):** Local businesses with phone numbers MUST include a `<a href="tel:+...">` in primary navigation desktop + mobile, plus a sticky mobile CTA bar at bottom. Click triggers PostHog `phone_click` + GA4 `tel_click`.

**Cookie Consent / GDPR:** If site targets EU: cookie banner with accept/reject. PostHog `persistence:'memory'` = no cookies (compliant by default). Google Analytics requires consent mode v2 (`gtag('consent', 'default', {analytics_storage:'denied'})` until accepted).

**NAP Consistency (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Name+Address+Phone must match EXACTLY across: site header, NAPFooter, JSON-LD LocalBusiness, Google Maps embed, contact page, `_gbp_sync.json`. Any divergence = build failure. Automated check in inspect.js: extract NAP from all sources, diff, fail if mismatch.

**Component Completeness:** All 16 local components must be available in template. Build prompt must reference: HeroWithPhoto, ServiceCards, TestimonialCarousel, MapEmbed, StickyPhoneCTA, NAPFooter, TrustBadges, ReviewCTA, GalleryGrid, BeforeAfterSlider, QuickActions, EmergencyBanner, SpeedDial, BookingEmbed, LocalSchemaGenerator, ResponsiveImage. Missing component = template drift.

**PWA Validation:** site.webmanifest present with correct name/icons/theme_color. Favicon set complete (ico+16+32+apple-touch+android-chrome 192+512). `<link rel="manifest">` in index.html.

**Print Stylesheet:** `@media print` rules present in index.css. Verify: nav/footer/sticky hidden, body white bg, link URLs printed.

**Service Area Pages (if applicable):** Each `/service-area/{city}` has unique H1, meta desc, localized content. No duplicate content across pages. All pages in sitemap.xml.

**URL Preservation (***BUILD-BREAKING***):** Parse original sitemap from `_scraped_content.json`. Every original URL must return 200 (actual page) or 301 (redirect to new location). Zero 404s for previously-indexed URLs. Generate `_redirects` file for Cloudflare Pages or equivalent server-side redirect map. Build gate: `node validate-urls.js` compares original sitemap URLs against new sitemap + `_redirects` — fail if any URL unaccounted.

**Citations & Sources (***BUILD-BREAKING — rules/citations.md***):** Every quantitative claim (%, N, $, ratio, comparison, year-claim) on every page MUST cite source via `<Citation refId="...">` resolving to `_citations.json` entry (APA 7th ed). Banned unsourced phrases: "studies show|research suggests|most users|industry-leading|trusted by|proven|widely-recognized|recent studies|experts agree|countless|numerous|many|often|typically". JSON-LD Article/BlogPosting/FAQPage/Claim schemas MUST include `citation: CreativeWork[]` array per source. Build gate: `node validate-citations.js dist/` greps `\d+%|\$\d+[MBK]|\d+x|\d+ users|since \d{4}` — any unsourced match fails build. Source hierarchy: peer-reviewed > .gov/.edu > primary data > industry research. Wikipedia rejected. Confidence>=0.85 requires 2+ cites.

**Content Migration Completeness:** New site word count must MATCH OR EXCEED original site word count from `_scraped_content.json`. All blog posts migrated as individual pages. Blog listing page with pagination present if original had blog. RSS feed at `/feed.xml` or `/rss.xml`. No substantive content discarded without explicit user approval.

**Donation Page (non-profit/church):** `/donate` or `/give` page present with both one-time and monthly options. Monthly selected by default. Suggested amounts visible. Stripe integration or link to existing platform. Donation CTA present on 3+ pages.

## Domain-Specific Quality Rules

**Restaurant:** Menu must have prices. Food photos must look appetizing (well-lit, styled). Hours prominently displayed. Online ordering CTA if platform exists.

**Salon/Barber:** Services with prices. Booking CTA prominent. Before/after gallery. Stylist profiles with photos.

**Medical:** Provider credentials displayed. HIPAA-compliant form language. Emergency info. Insurance accepted list.

**Legal:** Practice areas with descriptions. Attorney profiles with bar info. Free consultation CTA. Client testimonials with attribution.

**Non-profit:** Donation CTA in hero + footer + every page. Impact counters animated. Volunteer signup. 501(c)(3) status visible.

**SaaS:** Pricing tiers comparison. Free trial CTA. Integration logos. API docs link. Status page link. SOC2/GDPR badges if applicable.

## Generalization Principle

When any specific criticism is received about a generated site, it MUST be generalized into a rule that applies to ALL future builds. Example: "njsk.org colors are wrong" → "NEVER guess colors from business category; ALWAYS extract from logo/website." The criticism registry grows with every user feedback cycle.

## Automated Build Gates (***RUN POST-BUILD, FAIL HARD***)

Every projectsites.dev build MUST pass these automated gates before R2 upload. Wired in `package.json` `gate` script: `node scripts/validate-assets.mjs dist && node scripts/validate-meta.mjs dist && node scripts/validate-citations.mjs dist && node scripts/validate-h1.mjs dist && lhci autorun && playwright test --grep @gate`.

| Gate | Tool | Threshold | Fail Action |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Asset existence | `validate-assets.mjs` (skill 15) | 9 mandatory files + every ref resolves | exit 1 |
| Meta length | `validate-meta.mjs` | title 50–60ch, desc 120–156ch | exit 1 |
| H1 in shell | `validate-h1.mjs` | `<h1>` present before `<script>` in raw HTML | exit 1 |
| Citations | `validate-citations.mjs` | every `\d+%`/`\$\d+[MBK]`/`\d+x` cited APA | exit 1 |
| URL preservation | `validate-urls.mjs` | every original URL → 200 or 301 | exit 1 |
| Source parity | `compare-source.ts` | new word count ≥ original × 1.0, image count ≥ original × 1.4 | exit 1 |
| Lighthouse | `@lhci/cli` v0.15+ | Perf≥75, A11y≥95, BestPractices≥95, SEO≥95 | exit 1 |
| Accessibility | `@axe-core/playwright` v4.11+ | 0 WCAG 2.2 AA violations | exit 1 |
| Visual regression | Percy AI Visual Review / pixelmatch | <0.1% pixel diff vs baseline | warn → review |
| Image budget | `validate-image-budgets.mjs` | single ≤200KB, total ≤500KB | exit 1 |
| Cross-browser smoke | Playwright Chrome+Safari | homepage loads, no console errors at 6 breakpoints | exit 1 |
| Pseudo-element positioning | `validate-pseudo-position.mjs` (grep CSS for `::before\|::after` blocks containing `top:\|left:\|right:\|bottom:` → assert parent selector has `position:` declared) | every absolutely-positioned ::before/::after has parent `position: relative\|absolute\|fixed\|sticky` | exit 1 |
| Lightbox-on-logos forbidden | `validate-lightbox-targets.mjs` (grep dist/ source for `data-gallery="logos\|trusted\|sponsors\|partners\|institutions\|press\|publications\|awards"`) | zero matches — institutional logo grids must use hover-grayscale-to-color (skill 12 lightbox-classifier.md) NOT lightbox | exit 1 |
| Per-route metadata | `validate-route-metadata.mjs` (every `<Route path>` in App.tsx has matching entry in src/data/page-meta.ts OR data-derived meta from blogPosts[]) | 100% route coverage, no fallback `index.html` `<title>` showing on production routes | exit 1 |
| White-flash transition | Playwright records 60fps video of route transition on dark-themed sites → asserts NO frame contains average pixel-luminance >0.5 | dark sites pass, light sites N/A | exit 1 |
| PWA full kit | `validate-pwa.mjs` (skill 06 pwa-kit.md) | site.webmanifest valid + ≥6 icon entries + ≥2 real screenshots + sw.js registered + offline.html ≤30KB with NAP + Lighthouse PWA ≥0.95 | exit 1 |
| Publication crawl depth | `validate-publications.mjs` (skill 15 SKILL.md "Deep crawl per page") | `_publications.json` length ≥ source index item count, every entry has paraphrased summary + outbound URL + source logo + date | exit 1 |
| Logo transparency | `validate-logo-alpha.mjs` (Sharp corner-pixel sample) | every shipped logo PNG has alpha<255 on ≥1% of corner pixels (no white-rectangle floating logos) | exit 1 |
| Institutional logos resolved | `validate-institutional-logos.mjs` | every name in `_research.json.affiliations[]\|publications[].source\|sponsors[]\|partners[]` has a resolved logo file in dist/ | exit 1 |
| Grammar audit | `validate-grammar.mjs` (skill 09 grammar-audit.md GPT-4o-mini final pass) | zero grammar/spelling/typography errors flagged on every rendered page | exit 1 |
| Brand-hex social hover | `validate-social-hex.mjs` (skill 12 social-brand-hex.md) | every social-link icon `<a>` has hover/focus/active CSS using canonical platform hex | exit 1 |

## Lighthouse CI (***NON-NEGOTIABLE***)

`.lighthouserc.json` config:
```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "url": ["http://localhost:4173/", "http://localhost:4173/about", "http://localhost:4173/services", "http://localhost:4173/contact"],
      "numberOfRuns": 3,
      "settings": { "preset": "desktop", "throttling": { "cpuSlowdownMultiplier": 1 } }
    },
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:no-pwa",
      "assertions": {
        "categories:performance": ["error", { "minScore": 0.75 }],
        "categories:accessibility": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:best-practices": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:seo": ["error", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "largest-contentful-paint": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 2500 }],
        "cumulative-layout-shift": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 0.1 }],
        "interaction-to-next-paint": ["error", { "maxNumericValue": 200 }],
        "uses-text-compression": "error",
        "uses-responsive-images": "error",
        "modern-image-formats": "error",
        "uses-optimized-images": "error",
        "render-blocking-resources": ["warn", { "maxNumericValue": 200 }]
      }
    },
    "upload": { "target": "filesystem", "outputDir": "./.lighthouseci" }
  }
}
```

Mobile preset additionally enforced via second LHCI run with `"preset": "mobile"`. Both must pass.

For full-site coverage at scale, `unlighthouse` (single binary, parallel-crawls every route in sitemap, generates HTML report). Run on every PR via GitHub Action.

## Accessibility — axe-core via Playwright (***WCAG 2.2 AA, ZERO VIOLATIONS***)

`tests/accessibility.spec.ts`:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

const ROUTES = ['/', '/about', '/services', '/contact', '/blog', '/privacy', '/terms'];
const BREAKPOINTS = [375, 390, 768, 1024, 1280, 1920];

for (const route of ROUTES) {
  for (const width of BREAKPOINTS) {
    test(`a11y: ${route} @ ${width}px @gate`, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.setViewportSize({ width, height: 900 });
      await page.goto(route);
      const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
        .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa'])
        .disableRules(['color-contrast-enhanced'])  // AAA, not required
        .analyze();
      expect(results.violations, JSON.stringify(results.violations, null, 2)).toEqual([]);
    });
  }
}
```

Zero violations across all routes × all breakpoints = pass. WCAG 2.2 introduces 9 new criteria: focus appearance (2.4.11), focus not obscured min/enhanced (2.4.12/2.4.13), dragging movements (2.5.7), target size 24px (2.5.8), consistent help (3.2.6), redundant entry (3.3.7), accessible auth min/enhanced (3.3.8/3.3.9). axe-core v4.11+ checks all of these. ADA compliance deadline: 2027 state/local, 2028 federal.

## Source-Parity Diff (***FOR REBUILDS — `compare-source.ts`***)

When source URL provided, compare original vs new:

```typescript
const original = await crawl(sourceUrl, { maxPages: 1000 });
const newSite = await crawl(deployUrl, { maxPages: 1000 });

assert(newSite.wordCount >= original.wordCount * 1.0, `Word count regression: ${original.wordCount} → ${newSite.wordCount}`);
assert(newSite.imageCount >= original.imageCount * 1.4, `Image count below augmentation floor`);
assert(newSite.routes.length >= original.routes.length, `Route count dropped: ${original.routes.length} → ${newSite.routes.length}`);
for (const r of original.routes) {
  const res = await fetch(deployUrl + r);
  assert(res.status === 200 || (res.status === 301 && res.headers.get('location')), `Lost URL: ${r}`);
}
for (const doc of original.documents) {  // PDFs/DOCs/PPTs
  const res = await fetch(deployUrl + doc.path);
  assert(res.ok, `Missing preserved document: ${doc.path}`);
}
```

njsk-light.projectsites.dev failure mode (missing blog, missing media, single-page collapse) is exactly what this gate catches. Build fails before R2 upload.

## Visual Regression — 3-Tier Strategy

| Tier | Tool | When | Cost |
|------|------|------|------|
| Local dev | `pixelmatch` + golden screenshots | every save | free |
| PR | Chromatic via Storybook | per-PR per-component | free up to 5K snapshots/mo |
| Deploy | Percy AI Visual Review | per-deploy full-page 6 breakpoints | free up to 5K snapshots/mo |

Percy AI Visual Review (40% false-positive filtering, 3× faster than legacy Percy) handles the per-deploy gate. For component-level regression, Chromatic via Storybook. For local dev iteration, `pixelmatch` against golden PNGs in `tests/__golden__/`.

## Console-Error Gate (***POST-DEPLOY***)

After every deploy, Playwright loads each route and asserts zero console errors:

```typescript
test(`console clean: ${route} @gate`, async ({ page }) => {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  page.on('console', (msg) => { if (msg.type() === 'error') errors.push(msg.text()); });
  page.on('pageerror', (err) => errors.push(err.message));
  await page.goto(route);
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  expect(errors, errors.join('\n')).toEqual([]);
});
```

CSP violations, JS errors, missing resource 404s — all caught here. Fix before marking deploy complete.

## Recommendations Loop (***ZERO-RECOMMENDATIONS GATE***)

After all other gates pass, run `recommendations-checker` agent: GPT-4o detail:high inspects deployed homepage + 3 random sub-pages, returns markdown list of every "could be improved" observation. Loop: implement → redeploy → re-check. Done when checker returns empty list. Max 5 iterations.
