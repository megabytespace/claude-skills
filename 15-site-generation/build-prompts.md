# Build Prompts

The container runs ONE comprehensive Claude Code prompt. This prompt encompasses all build phases. The prompt is dynamically assembled from form data + research results. Claude Code reads pre-written context files (`_research.json`, `_brand.json`, `_assets.json`, etc.) and customizes the pre-installed template.

## Master Prompt Template

```
# Build a Stunning Website for {{businessName}}

Read ALL _ prefixed files in this directory for context:
- _research.json — business profile, hours, phone, address, reviews, geo
- _brand.json — colors, fonts, personality, logo URL
- _scraped_content.json — content from existing website (if available)
- _assets.json — manifest of all images in assets/ folder
- _image_profiles.json — GPT-4o analysis of each image
- _videos.json — YouTube/video URLs and metadata
- _places.json — Google Places enrichment data
- _form_data.json — user-submitted form data
- _domain_features.json — category-specific requirements

Read ~/.agentskills/15-site-generation/ for full methodology.
Cross-reference skills: 09 (brand extraction, copy rules), 10 (design system, local business patterns), 11 (animation, prefers-reduced-motion), 12 (media orchestration, image generation), 07 (quality verification, accessibility), 13 (analytics auto-provision, local conversion tracking).

## Your Mission
Transform this Vite+React+Tailwind+shadcn/ui project into the most gorgeous website
this business has ever had. Start from the pre-installed template in ~/template.
Every image in assets/ MUST appear on the site. Every fact must come from research data.

## Phase 1: Foundation (generates 90% of the site)

### Brand Configuration
- Extract exact colors from _brand.json (NEVER guess from category)
- Set colors in tailwind.config.ts: primary, secondary, accent from brand
- Use brand fonts (or Inter/Satoshi fallback) in tailwind.config.ts
- Logo from assets/logo.* in EVERY page header

### Pages (match original site structure — NEVER reduce page count)
- Homepage: hero with brand image + gradient overlay, selling points grid, about preview, testimonials, FAQ, CTA
- About: 2000+ words, verifiable facts from research, team section if data exists
- Services/Menu/Features: detailed grid with images, pricing if available
- Contact: form (if email found), Google Maps embed (if geo), social links (verified only), full NAP
- Blog: migrate ALL blog/news/updates from _scraped_content.json — individual route per post, listing page with pagination, RSS feed. Blog content is SEO equity — never discard it.
- Donation page (non-profit/church): one-time + monthly toggle, default to MONTHLY. Suggested amounts from category. Stripe integration or link to existing platform.
- Additional pages: create a page for EVERY distinct page in _scraped_content.json. Content-rich originals get rebuilt as full pages. Thin pages may be merged but MUST get 301 redirects.

### Content Migration (***NEVER DISCARD CONTENT***)
The original site's content is the business's accumulated SEO equity and institutional knowledge. Treat it as sacred.
- Migrate ALL text content from _scraped_content.json — rewrite for quality but preserve substance
- Every blog post, news article, update → individual page at matching URL path
- Team bios, service descriptions, FAQ answers, event archives → all migrated
- Only discard: broken markup, "test" pages, truly empty pages, exact duplicates
- When combining thin pages: content merges into a richer page, old URLs get 301s
- Word count of new site should MATCH OR EXCEED original (not 50% — 100%+)

### URL Preservation (***NON-NEGOTIABLE***)
Parse _scraped_content.json for all original URL paths. Every original URL must resolve:
- Same path → actual page (preferred): `/about-us` → About page at `/about-us`
- Different path → 301 redirect: if original `/our-team` merges into `/about`, add redirect
- Blog posts: preserve exact slug `/blog/2024/summer-event` → same route
- Generate `_redirects` file (Cloudflare Pages format) or server-side redirect map
- Validate: every URL from original sitemap.xml returns 200 or 301 — never 404
- Build gate: compare original sitemap URLs vs new sitemap + redirects, fail if any URL unaccounted

### Design System (***skill 10 — MANDATORY***)
Read ~/.agentskills/10-experience-and-design-system/SKILL.md for full design system.
Apply ALL patterns from "Local Business Design Patterns (SITE GENERATION)" section.

- Dark-first: dark base color from _brand.json (fallback: extracted from logo/site), brand-appropriate overrides via OKLCH
- Typography: clamp() fluid scale (1rem→1.125rem body, 2.5rem→4rem hero), brand heading font or fallback
- Cascade layers: @layer reset, base, components, utilities — native CSS nesting, no preprocessor
- Container queries for component-responsive cards (not just viewport breakpoints)
- 10+ @keyframes: fadeInUp, slideIn, scaleIn, shimmer, float, pulse, gradientShift, borderGlow, parallax, typewriter
- Glassmorphism cards: bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/10
- Gradient text on key headings: bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r
- 25+ inline SVG decorative elements (geometric shapes, section dividers)
- IntersectionObserver on every section for scroll-triggered animations
- Staggered animation delays on card grids (0.1s between each)
- Anti-slop check: grep for banned words before build (see skill 09 copy-rules)
- Apple Test: "Would Apple ship this?" If no → redesign before deploy

### Content Rules (***PRESERVE EVERYTHING***)
- Word count must MATCH OR EXCEED original site (never less content than before)
- 5000+ words minimum real content (from research + scraped content) — most rebuilds will far exceed this
- Migrate ALL substantive text from _scraped_content.json — rewrite for quality, preserve substance
- Blog posts, news articles, event recaps → individual pages with original publish dates
- Every claim factually accurate from _research.json
- Address links → Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination={{encoded_address}}
- Phone → tel: links | Email → mailto: links
- NO lorem ipsum | NO placeholder text | NO TODO stubs
- Primary keyword "{{businessType}} in {{city}}" in H1, title, meta, first paragraph

### Images (***CRITICAL***)
- USE EVERY IMAGE in assets/ — check _image_profiles.json for placement suggestions
- Hero: assets/hero-* or highest quality_score image as background with gradient overlay
- Gallery: full-width slider/carousel with ALL images
- Service cards: relevant images matched by suggested_placement
- No external image URLs (hotlinking blocked)
- All images: lazy loading (except hero), width/height attributes, descriptive alt text

### Image Optimization Pipeline (***NON-NEGOTIABLE — skill 12***)
Every image in assets/ MUST be processed before build:
1. Generate responsive variants: 320w, 640w, 1280w, 1920w (skip if source narrower)
2. Convert to WebP (quality 80) + AVIF (quality 70) for each variant
3. Generate PNG fallback at 1280w for legacy browsers
4. Generate 20px blur placeholder (base64 WebP) per image
5. Extract dominant color per image for CSS placeholder
6. Store all variants alongside originals in assets/

Use `<ResponsiveImage>` component from `src/components/local/ResponsiveImage`:
```html
<ResponsiveImage src="assets/hero.jpg" alt="Business exterior" eager />
```
Renders `<picture>` with AVIF→WebP→fallback, srcset 320-1920w, blur placeholder.

Hero image: `eager` + `fetchpriority="high"` + preload link in `<head>`.
All other images: `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"`.
Max single optimized image: 200KB. Total page images: <500KB.
Original PNG/JPG kept as source, never served to browser.

### Interactions
- Every button: hover (scale + glow), active (press), focus (ring)
- Every link: hover (color change + underline animation)
- Every card: hover (lift + shadow + border glow)
- Smooth scroll on ALL anchor links (scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' }), never #href)
- Mobile hamburger menu with slide-in animation
- Back-to-top button with fade-in on scroll

### SEO (complete implementation)
- <title> under 60 chars: "{{primaryKeyword}} | {{businessName}}"
- <meta description> under 160 chars with keyword + CTA
- <link rel="canonical" href="https://{{slug}}.projectsites.dev{{path}}">
- JSON-LD LocalBusiness with ALL available structured data
- FAQPage schema on FAQ section
- BreadcrumbList schema on sub-pages
- Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags

- Place in: thank-you state after form submit, contact page, ReviewCTA component
- QR code SVG in assets/review-qr.svg for print materials

### Print Stylesheet
Add to index.css:
```css
@media print {
  header, footer, .sticky-cta, .speed-dial, nav, .back-to-top { display: none; }
  body { background: white; color: black; font-size: 12pt; }
  a[href]::after { content: " (" attr(href) ")"; font-size: 0.8em; }
  img { max-width: 100%; }
}
```

### PWA Manifest
Generate `public/site.webmanifest`:
```json
{
  "name": "{{businessName}}",
  "short_name": "{{shortName}}",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "{{brand_primary}}",
  "background_color": "{{brand_background}}",
  "icons": [
    {"src": "/android-chrome-192x192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png"},
    {"src": "/android-chrome-512x512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png"}
  ]
}
```
Add `<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">` to index.html.

### SMS Deep Links
Alongside every `tel:` link, add `sms:` link option. Track as `sms_click` event.
Mobile: show both "Call" and "Text" buttons side by side.

### Competitor Comparison Page (IF competitor data exists)
{{#if competitors}}
- Generate `/why-choose-us` page from _research.json.competitors[]
- H1: "Why Choose {{businessName}} Over the Competition"
- Comparison table: features, rating, reviews, years in business
- Every comparison factual from research data
- JSON-LD: no schema needed, pure content play
{{/if}}

### FAQ Auto-Generation from Reviews
Mine _research.json.trust.reviews[] for recurring themes/questions.
Generate 8-12 FAQ items with FAQPage schema. Real customer language = better AI citation.
Place on dedicated /faq page AND inline on relevant service pages.

### Weather-Aware Hero (outdoor businesses only)
{{#if outdoor_business}}
- Fetch weather from _research.json.operations.geo via free weather API
- Swap hero messaging based on conditions: rain→"Rainy season? Book your {service}" | snow→"Snow removal available" | heat→"Beat the heat with {service}"
- Fallback: standard hero if API unavailable
{{/if}}

### Domain-Specific Features
Read _domain_features.json and implement ALL listed features for this business category.

## Phase 2: Build + Inspect + Fix

After customizing all files:
1. Run `npm run build` — fix ANY errors
2. Run `node /home/cuser/inspect.js dist/index.html` — read the GPT-4o critique
3. Fix ALL issues scoring below 8/10 in the critique
4. Run `npm run build` again — verify zero errors
5. If inspect score < 8: repeat fix+build (max 3 iterations)

## Phase 3: Polish Pass

Review the entire site one more time:
1. Every section has a dark or brand-colored background? No plain white sections.
2. Every button/link has hover + active + focus styles?
3. Smooth scroll on all same-page links?
4. All Lucide icon imports are valid names?
5. Mobile responsive at 375px? No horizontal overflow?
6. Copyright year is current?
7. Logo in every page header?
8. Footer has Privacy Policy + Terms links?
9. No console.log statements?
10. All URLs use HTTPS?
11. Fonts have preconnect hints?
12. Contact form only if business email exists?
13. Social links only to verified URLs?

## Phase 4: Upload to R2

After successful build, run: `node /home/cuser/upload-to-r2.mjs`
This uploads all dist/ files to R2 at sites/{{slug}}/{{version}}/.
```

## Prompt Assembly Logic

The Worker builds this prompt dynamically:
1. Read form data (business name, address, category, notes, uploaded files)
2. Inject research results into template variables
3. Select domain features from _domain_features.json
4. Conditional blocks expand based on available data (email, geo, rating, videos)
5. Write assembled prompt to `_prompt.txt` in build directory

## Inspect Script Integration

`/home/cuser/inspect.js` — pre-baked in Docker image. Takes HTML file path, sends first 14KB to GPT-4o with "senior Stripe web designer" persona. Scores 1-10 across: color contrast, typography, layout/spacing, animations, images, mobile, brand consistency, visual polish. Returns `{ score, issues[], recommendations[] }` as JSON to stdout. 25s timeout. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Prompt Evolution

Every successful build → analyze output quality. Patterns that improve quality get folded into this prompt template. Criticism from users → generalized into rules added to quality-gates.md. The prompt chain gets better with every iteration.
