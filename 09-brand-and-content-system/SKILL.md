## Core Principle

**Brand is not decoration — it's trust.** Every word, image, and interaction either builds or erodes trust. The content system must produce copy that is specific, credible, and conversion-aware while feeling authentic to the product's identity.

### The Three Brand Goals (Shape Every Content Decision)
1. **End-user value** — does this content help the user accomplish their goal?
2. **Business strategy** — does this content support conversion through ethical psychology?
3. **projectsites.dev reputation** — does this content make our ecosystem look world-class?

### Brian's Brand Voice (from 865 product conversations)
- **Slogans:** "Open-Source Wizardry. 100% Wizardry. 0% Robes." | "Often imitated, never duplicated."
- **Newsletter:** "Lab Insights Journal" | "Lab Notes Newsletter"
- **Handle:** @HeyMegabyte on all platforms (@heymegabyteofficial on Instagram)
- **Email:** hey@megabyte.space (general) | brian@megabyte.space (personal)
- **Tone:** Professional but irreverent. "Hey" not "Hi." First-person from Megabyte Labs perspective.
- **Emphasis patterns:** always "cross-platform" and "open-source" in product descriptions
- **Install Doctor framing:** always "single command" or "one-liner"
- **Hero tagline pattern:** "[Topic] **Innovation**" (e.g., "Automation Innovation")
- **Footer CTA:** "Let's Talk" or "Get in Touch" (statistically best per Brian's research)
- **Consulting rate:** $140/hr standard, $70/hr nonprofit (50% discount)
- **Hosting rate:** $100/mo WordPress hosting

### Social Presence
@HeyMegabyte on: Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Telegram, Threads, Tumblr, Vimeo, WhatsApp, X/Twitter, YouTube
YouTube playlist: "Megabyte Minis" | Dev.to organization | Patreon for donations

### Psychology-Informed Content Strategy (04/wisdom)
- **Reciprocity:** give genuine value in the content itself (teach, don't just market)
- **Social proof:** place testimonials, stats, and logos near every conversion point
- **Authority:** demonstrate expertise through depth, specificity, and real numbers
- **Unity:** use "we/us" language to create shared identity with users
- **Peak-End Rule:** the last section of every page should be the most compelling

## Brand Extraction (Rebuilds)

When rebuilding an existing site or product:

### 1. Capture Before Inventing
- Screenshot the existing site (Wayback Machine if down)
- Extract: logo, colors, fonts, tone, tagline, imagery style
- Identify: what's worth preserving, what needs improvement
- **Never discard existing brand equity without explicit permission**

### 2. Color Extraction Pipeline (NON-NEGOTIABLE — extract, never invent)

**The #1 brand failure mode: inventing colors instead of extracting them from the real website and logo.**

Example: njsk.org (Newark soup kitchen) has a distinctive burgundy/maroon throughout their site
and logo. A naive LLM guesses "warm blue/green for nonprofits." That's WRONG. The correct
answer is to extract the actual burgundy from the real site and use it as the primary color.

**The rule: ALWAYS extract colors from the actual website and logo FIRST. Only invent colors
for businesses with zero web presence.**

#### Step 1: Screenshot the original website with Playwright
```typescript
// Take screenshot of the homepage
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://njsk.org', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });
```

#### Step 2: Send screenshot to GPT-4o for color extraction
```
Prompt: "Analyze this website screenshot. Extract the EXACT brand colors used.
Focus on:
1. Logo colors (highest priority — the logo defines the brand)
2. Header/nav background and text colors
3. Primary CTA button colors
4. Accent colors used for links, highlights, borders
5. Background colors (main and section alternates)

Return hex codes for each color found. Identify which is primary (most prominent
in the logo and headers), secondary, and accent. Do NOT suggest alternative colors.
Do NOT pick colors based on the industry. Extract ONLY what is actually on the page."
```

#### Step 3: Cross-reference with logo colors
- If the logo has a dominant color (e.g., burgundy), that IS the primary color
- The logo color trumps everything — it was chosen intentionally by the business
- If the website uses the logo color consistently, confidence is HIGH
- If the website uses different colors than the logo, flag the inconsistency

#### Step 4: Build the palette from extracted colors
```
Priority order for primary color selection:
1. Dominant color in the logo (highest weight)
2. Color used in the header/nav
3. Color used in CTA buttons
4. Color used for headings and emphasis

DO NOT:
- Substitute a "more modern" color for the extracted one
- Pick blue because "nonprofits use blue" — look at the ACTUAL site
- Use the Emdash/Megabyte defaults (#00E5FF cyan) for client brands
- Infer colors from the business category — that's lazy and wrong
```

#### Step 5: Validate the palette
- Check WCAG AA contrast of primary color on dark background (#060610)
- If contrast fails: slightly lighten/brighten the extracted color (shift L in HSL by +10-15%)
- NEVER change the hue — a business's burgundy should stay burgundy, not become red or pink
- Generate a harmonious palette: primary (from logo), secondary (complementary), surface, text

#### When there is NO website at all:
Only then may you infer colors based on industry + AI suggestion:
- Use 04/wisdom (Wisdom) color psychology as guidance
- Generate 3 palette options and A/B test with GPT-4o vision on mockups
- Document that colors are AI-generated, not extracted

### 3. Logo Requirement (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Every project MUST have a premium logo.** See Skill 12 for the full process:
- **If the business has a logo:** Find it (Logo.dev → Brandfetch → scrape site → Google Images → favicon). Visually inspect quality. AI-enhance if needed.
- **If no logo exists:** Generate with Ideogram v3 API. Create 4-6 variants. A/B select the best one using GPT-4o vision scoring. Process into full favicon + brand asset set.
- **If user doesn't like it:** Regenerate with the same process, varying style. Never settle for mediocre.
- The logo appears EVERYWHERE: header, favicon, OG images, emails, app icons. It must be premium.

### 4. Brand Audit Checklist
```
[ ] Logo found, enhanced, or generated (see Skill 12 for full process)
[ ] Logo visually inspected and rated >= 7/10 by GPT-4o
[ ] Logo works at 16px (favicon) AND 512px (app icon)

```

## Brand Inference (New Products)

When no existing brand:

### Business-Type Inference
| Product Type | Default Tone | Default Style |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Developer tool | Technical, direct, no fluff | Dark, monospace accents, code snippets |
| SaaS platform | Professional, benefit-focused | Clean, card-based, gradients |
| Agency/portfolio | Confident, aspirational | Full-bleed images, bold type |
| E-commerce | Friendly, trust-building | Product-focused, social proof heavy |
| Non-profit | Warm, mission-driven | Impact imagery, donation CTAs |
| Community | Inclusive, energetic | Member stories, activity feeds |
| API service | Technical, precise | Documentation-forward, usage examples |

### Default Brand System (Emdash/Megabyte ONLY — NOT for client brands)

**These defaults apply ONLY to projectsites.dev itself and Megabyte Labs properties.**
**For client/generated websites: ALWAYS extract colors from their actual website and logo.**

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary | Cyan #00E5FF |
| Secondary | Blue #50AAE3 |
| Background | Near-black #060610 |
| Body font | Sora, sans-serif |
| Heading font | Space Grotesk, sans-serif |
| Mono font | JetBrains Mono, monospace |
| Tone | Technical, confident, direct |
| Style | Dark-first, gradient accents, premium feel |

**Common mistake:** Using #00E5FF cyan as the primary color for a client's nonprofit site
when their real logo is burgundy. The cyan is OUR brand, not theirs. ALWAYS extract first.

## Copy System

### Headline Rules
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature
- Be specific (not "The Best Tool" but "Ship 3x Faster")
- Use numbers when credible
- Match the product's sophistication level to the audience
- Max 8 words for primary headlines

### Subheading Rules
- Expand on the headline's promise
- Add specificity or social proof
- 15-25 words
- Create curiosity or urgency

### Body Copy Rules
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Active voice
- Concrete language (not abstract)
- Benefit-oriented (what does the user get?)

### CTA Rules
- Specific action ("Start Free Trial" not "Submit")
- Create urgency without being sleazy
- Primary CTA: high-contrast button with gradient
- Secondary CTA: text link or ghost button
- Every page has at least one CTA
- CTAs above the fold and at page end

## Brian's Voice (Copy System)

> Sharp. Punchy. Irreverent. Love-forward. No bullshit.

### Tone by Context
- **Nonprofit:** Warm but direct, never preachy. **SaaS:** Technical but human, zero fluff.
- **Hero:** Bold, benefit-first, urgent. **Errors:** Human, helpful, never blame user.
- **Legal:** Plain English, readable at 8th grade level.

### Microcopy Rules
- Labels: conversational ("Your email" not "Email Address"). Placeholders: example data.
- Validation: friendly ("Looks like that email needs an @"). Success: celebratory ("You're in!").

### Examples (Brian's Voice)
- "The same technology reshaping Wall Street, pointed at a soup kitchen."
- "One number. No hold music. No bureaucracy."
- "Built by one person. Powered by everything."

### Anti-Patterns (Never Use)
- "Welcome to...", "Discover...", "Unleash...", "Revolutionize...", "Click here", "Submit", "Learn more"
- Corporate slop: "innovative platform that leverages cutting-edge AI..."
- Empty filler: "We're excited to announce..."

### Conversion Research (CXL, Copyhackers, HBR)
- Headlines with numbers convert 36% better; benefit-oriented outperform feature-oriented by 28%
- Social proof near CTAs increases click-through 15-20%
- Specificity builds trust: "$47/month" beats "affordable pricing"
- Named individuals raise 2x more than statistics alone; show before -> after

### Wisdom in Copy (04/wisdom)

#### Servant Framing
Write from the user's perspective, not ours:
- "Start helping today" > "Sign up now" (serve them, don't command)
- "See what's possible" > "Learn more" (inspire curiosity)
- "Join 1,200 builders" > "Create account" (unity, belonging)

#### Truth Over Hype (Proverbs 12:22, Marcus Aurelius)
- Real numbers: "127 donors" not "hundreds of supporters"
- Specific impact: "$47 feeds a family for a week" not "your donation helps"
- No superlatives without evidence: prove "fastest" or don't say it

#### Reciprocity (Cialdini)
Give value in the copy itself. Teach something. Share an insight. Make the reader smarter by reading your page, even if they never convert.

### Copy Quality Checklist
```
[ ] No placeholder text anywhere
[ ] No "Click here" or "Learn more" CTAs
[ ] Hero headline <= 8 words
[ ] Flesch score >= 60
[ ] All numbers specific, not vague
[ ] Error messages human and helpful
[ ] No corporate jargon or AI slop words
[ ] Servant framing (user benefit, not our feature)
[ ] Truth over hype (provable claims only)
```
