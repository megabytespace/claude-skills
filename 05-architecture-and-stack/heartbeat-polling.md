# Heartbeat Polling for Cloudflare Workflows

Cloudflare Workflows have a ~25min per-step timeout and ~1MB step output limit. Long-running jobs (AI builds, batch processing) easily exceed both. Heartbeat polling solves both constraints.

## Pattern
```
Step 1: start-job
  → POST /build to container with payload
  → Container starts async work, returns { jobId } immediately (~1s)

Steps 2..N: heartbeat-{i} (loop, max 120 × 30s = 60min)
  → sleep 30s → GET /status?jobId=X
  → Returns { status, step, elapsed, fileCount, error }
  → Each poll is a tiny step (~5s) — never hits timeout
  → Break when status !== 'running'

Step N+1: fetch-result
  → GET /result?jobId=X
  → Upload large output to R2 INSIDE the step (avoids output limit)
  → Return only metadata (version string, file count)
```

## Why This Works
Each heartbeat step: 30s sleep + 5s fetch = 35s total. Well under 25min limit. Step output: ~200 bytes (status JSON). Well under 1MB. Total polling: 120 × 30s = 60min max. Configurable via MAX_POLLS constant.

## Stable Container IDs
CF Containers use Durable Object IDs. Use `idFromName(stableKey)` so all steps talk to the SAME container instance. Key pattern: `${slug}-build-${siteId.slice(0,8)}`. NEVER create new IDs per step — that spawns new containers.

## Step Output Management
Large data (files, images) must NOT be returned as step output. Upload to R2/KV inside the step, return only a reference key. This keeps every step under 1MB and avoids serialization overhead.

## Container HTTP Server
Minimal Node.js HTTP server on port 8080. Three endpoints: POST /build (start async), GET /status (poll), GET /result (fetch+cleanup). Job store is in-memory (container lives for the duration of one build). Container cleans up build dir after /result is fetched.

## Timeout Budgeting
Container timeout = timeoutMin × 60000 (default 45min). Workflow polls up to MAX_POLLS × POLL_INTERVAL (default 60min). Always set workflow budget > container budget so the workflow can detect container timeout vs. still-running. Log elapsed time in heartbeats for debugging.

## Error Handling
Container crash → /status returns error or times out → workflow marks site as error. Build timeout → MAX_POLLS exceeded → workflow marks error. /result with 0 files → treated as error even if exit code=0.
